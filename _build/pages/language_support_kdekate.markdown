_"The KDE Advanced Text Editor, or Kate, is a source code editor developed by the KDE free software community.
It has been a part of KDE Software Compilation since version 2.2, which was first released in 2001. Intended 
for software developers, it features syntax highlighting, code folding, customizable layouts, regular expression

## Setup Syntax Highlighting and Coloring

The file for syntax highlighting can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/smallbasic/smallbasic.syntax-highlighting/tree/main/kate)

Copy the file "smallbasic.xml" into the folder "~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/".
Most probably this folder does not exist. Please create it. Restart Kate and chose "SmallBASIC" for highlighting.
